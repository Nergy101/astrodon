# Getting Started with Performance Testing

This is the first test blog post used for benchmarking the Astrodon build process. It contains various markdown features to simulate a real-world blog post.

## Code Examples

Here's a code block with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
function benchmark() {
  const start = performance.now();
  // Build process here
  const end = performance.now();
  return end - start;
}
```

## Lists and Formatting

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- `Inline code` for technical terms

### Nested Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
   - Nested bullet
   - Another nested item
3. Third item

## Tables

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Markdown | ✅ | Fully supported |
| Code blocks | ✅ | With syntax highlighting |
| Tables | ✅ | Standard markdown tables |

## Blockquotes

> "Performance testing is crucial for maintaining build speed."

## Links

Check out the [Astrodon documentation](https://github.com/Nergy101/astrodon) for more information.

## More Content

This paragraph adds more content to simulate a longer blog post. It includes various markdown features and formatting to ensure the benchmark test covers all aspects of the build process.

The build process should handle all these features efficiently, including:
- Multiple headers
- Code blocks with different languages
- Tables with various content
- Links and references
- Images (if added)
- Complex nested structures
