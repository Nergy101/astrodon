# Advanced Benchmarking Techniques

This second blog post explores more advanced benchmarking scenarios and includes additional markdown complexity.

## Complex Code Examples

Multiple code blocks with different languages:

```python
def calculate_performance():
    import time
    start = time.time()
    # Simulate work
    time.sleep(0.1)
    end = time.time()
    return end - start
```

```javascript
async function asyncBenchmark() {
  const start = performance.now();
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
  const end = performance.now();
  return end - start;
}
```

## Definition Lists

Term 1
: Definition for term 1

Term 2

: Alternative definition

## Task Lists

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [x] Another completed task
- [ ] Another incomplete task

## Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote content.

## More Complex Tables

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 | Header 4 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
| Long cell content | Short | Medium length | Very long cell content here |
| A | B | C | D |
